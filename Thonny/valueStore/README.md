ValueStore is a highly available and consistent key-value store designed specifically for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, offered as part of the services provided by Anedya. It provides a mechanism for storing and retrieving data using key-value pairs, organized within namespaces for efficient data management. From the overview, it appears as a normal key-value store, but it's designed to solve some of the very important IoT use-case scenarios.

## Operation
### Read Operationsâ€‹
- **Node-Level Scope:** A node can read data from its own namespace (matching node ID).
- **Global Scope:** All nodes can read data from any global namespace. This facilitates access to shared data sets across the entire system.
### Write Operations
- **Node-Level Scope:** A node can only write data to its own namespace (matching node ID). This restricts nodes from modifying data belonging to other devices or global namespaces.
- **Global Scope:** Only applications can write to or modify global namespaces using Platform APIs or the Anedya Dashboard. This ensures controlled modification of shared data sets to maintain data integrity.
